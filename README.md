Hello. 
existing circuits, breaking away from limitations, I suggest a way to open the next era. 

This is '점' logic. 
Each node replaces the transistors, 
It breaks away from the physical limit of the transistor. 

There is no limit to the maximum number of nodes, Considering your safety, make sure to 'limit the maximum 4×4×4 grid'. 

Dangerous challenges beyond the maximum range,
Recommended in a safe and isolated experimental environment.

For more information, refer to '0.5v'.
